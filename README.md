Hydra (by Olivia Jack) https://github.com/hydra-synth. Hydra is a wonderful live-coding environment for artists.
Playground - an experimental "Agent oriented" live coding system for kids developed by Jamie Faye Fenton at the Apple Vivarium Project in the 1980s (with Alan Kay).
Playground featured "agent rules", which are a collection of expressions that run in parallel. The first Playground used a simple functional language, wass written in C, and ran fast. The second version was written in Smalltalk which was soul-crushing slow. The second version did use a natural-language-ish syntax which was kind of cool. 
(The Scratch programming language is a great granddaughter of this, along with Logo).

The idea is to pull ideas from both places and come up with something new.
